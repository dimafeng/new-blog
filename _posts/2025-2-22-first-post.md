I’m Dmitry—a hands-on engineering leader with over 15 years of industry experience. If you’ve followed my previous (purely technical) blog, you’ll notice a big shift here: this blog will focus on engineering leadership.

I plan to use this space as a collection of my personal notes, a platform to share insights from my current and past work, and a sandbox for exploring new ideas. Over time, I may revisit and update existing posts to keep them relevant and reflective of my evolving perspective.

An aspirational goal, if all goes well, is to organize these articles into a structured format and release them as a free e-book. It’s just an idea at this point, but I’m excited to see how it might develop as I continue writing.

Thank you for joining me on this new journey. I look forward to sharing thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned in engineering leadership—here’s to many more posts to come!
